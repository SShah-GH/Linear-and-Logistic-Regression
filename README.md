# Image Classification using Logistic Regression:

# Description

This project is a custom library of linear and logistic regression algotithms. It was created using python while taking advantage of fundamental machine learning techniques to create a fast and easy to use library. Along with this, we have used the library to create an image classifier which acts on the MNIST dataset in order to recognise handwriting.
